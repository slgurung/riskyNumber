        <h3>riskyNumber:</h3>
        <p>riskyNumber is a web platform for financial information analytics, primarily for the stock 
        market data. This is not a commercial product. This platform is being developed for personal 
        education & research purposes only. At the moment, this platform is in it's very early stages
        of development.<br><br>
        The majority of information is derived from the various websites using numerous web-scraping
        technologies based on Python. I can't be sure about the accuracy of financial data and other
        information you find in this platform. In the future, the financial data and information might 
        be imported to this app from reliable commercial sources if it is feasible. Until then, this is 
        just an ongoing personal research project. I hope this app will become a great source for the 
        investors in the very near future. Please visit the platform more frequently for the updates. 
        Thank you for your visit today.<br><br>
